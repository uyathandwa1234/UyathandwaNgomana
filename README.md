Hi I'm Uyathandwa 

I'm an ICT student based in Cape Town with a strong interest in software
development and software testing.

I enjoy learning by building practical projects and understanding how
applications and systems work behind the scenes. I’m currently developing
my skills in Java, Python, SQL, and Git through hands-on practice and
coursework.

# What I’m currently working on
- Java applications, including basic GUI and file-handling projects
- Python practice projects to strengthen problem-solving skills
- SQL queries and database fundamentals
- Learning and applying software testing principles

# What I’m looking for
- Internship or learnership opportunities
- Junior or entry-level roles where I can grow and gain real-world experience
- Opportunities to learn from experienced developers and testers
